# Objective
<!--

The test goals. e.g.: Evaluate the channel creation and notifications settings.

-->

# Requirements

## Environment
<!--
What is the environment that should be tested and how it should be prepared.
-->
* Where the tests should run? <!-- Which interface is being tested. It can be a prototype, deployed version, a legacy interface, etc. e.g.: The test needs to run in Rocket.Chat version 4.12.1. -->
* Preparation: <!-- How should the interface be prepared. e.g: Create a new account for the participant in a Rocket.Chat server. -->
* Instructions to get this interface: <!-- Provide some instructions to install/ get the program which is being tested for facilitators to configure their environment. Reset the environment for each test. -->

## User profile

<!--

Describe the target users you are looking for the test and how many users. You'll need the same amount of participants for each profile. e.g.: 
* Users that have never used Rocket.Chat, but have used Zulip or Slack.
* Users that have never used this sort of communication software.

-->

# Test design
## Tasks
<!--

A list of tasks that the participant has to perform. e.g.:

-->

* <!-- Change the program theme. -->
* <!-- Change the background color. -->

## Scenarios
<!--

A list of scenarios for the participant to perform the tasks. They should put the participant in a context and not give specific hints about what you want the participant to do. e.g.:

-->
1. <!-- You have some private information concerning the company that you want to discuss with your team. Please, create a channel named "Secret Meeting" for that and add three users to it. **Expected behavior: Open "Edit" menu, go to the last option "Preferences". Expected behavior: Click on the pencil with paper icon. In the dropdown menu, select "# Channel" and toggle the "Private Channel" configuration if it is unselected.**-->
2. <!-- You have been receiving notifications in your phone outside working hours, but you don't want to see messages in your free time. Please, change your notifications settings to avoid having them on your phone. **Expected behavior: Click on your profile picture. In the dropdown menu, select "My Account". In the side menu, click "Preferences", notifications and change the value in the select menu labeled as "Push Mobile Notifications For" to "Nothing".**-->
